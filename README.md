# SEO COMMERCE

This is an very simple app builded with rails, to figure out seo examples in my personal blog.

## How to run:
- To make my life easier I used docker, to run in your machine just have the docker and run: <br>
  `docker-compose up --build`

## Hosting:
- Cause I'm a poor boy I'm using heroku in free version (Is very good tool, the best to test haha) <br>
